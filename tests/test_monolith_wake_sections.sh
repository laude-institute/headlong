# thinkers/monolith/step against a throwaway identity with a stubbed shellm
# that captures the --prompt-file. Pins: the section appears with a memory
# matched to the stream, the names shown land in the state file and are not
# shown again next wake, MONOLITH_RELATED_MEMORIES=0 removes the section, the
# goal-review hint fires on the first wake and not on the next, and the
# active-goals section lists a todo with its type.
